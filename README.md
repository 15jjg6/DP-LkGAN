Repository for Applied Mathematics and Engineering Final Year Thesis Project: Producing Differentially Private Data using LkGAN

## Abstract
**will add abstract here**
## Software Implementation
All source code used to generate the results and figures is written in python and executed through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks. The MNIST dataset is built into tensorflow and is directly loaded into the code. 
## Downloading the code 
You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/15jjg6/DP-LkGAN.git
```
